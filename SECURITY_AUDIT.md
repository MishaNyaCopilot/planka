# Planka Security Audit Report (Limited Public Access - ~200 Users)

## Context Adjustment
This audit has been adjusted for a project accessible via internet but not actively promoted (known only to the team and limited users). The system faces external threats but with low discoverability risk. Security measures balance protection against potential external attacks with operational usability.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Security Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. **Vulnerable Dependencies**
- **Issue**: Server has 16 moderate severity vulnerabilities, primarily in the `validator` package
- **Details**: URL validation bypass vulnerability (GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx) affecting the entire Sails.js framework chain
- **Risk**: Potential remote code execution or data manipulation through internet-accessible endpoints
- **Recommendation**: Update dependencies immediately, especially validator to >=13.15.20
- **Priority**: Critical - affects system stability and data integrity

### 2. **Environment Variables Exposed**
- **Issue**: The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials that could be leaked
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through misconfiguration or attacks
- **Recommendation**: Use strong, unique secrets and remove demo credentials
- **Priority**: Critical - fundamental security hygiene

### 3. **CSRF Protection Disabled**
- **Issue**: CSRF protection is commented out in `server/config/security.js`
- **Risk**: Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks possible via internet-accessible interface
- **Recommendation**: Enable CSRF protection for production
- **Priority**: Critical - protects against external attacks

### 4. **Input Validation Gaps**
- **Issue**: Limited use of HTML escaping/sanitization functions despite available libraries
- **Risk**: Potential XSS through user-generated content accessible via web interface
- **Recommendation**: Implement consistent input sanitization for user content
- **Priority**: High - affects data safety and user trust

## ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Security Concerns (Consider Fixing)

### 5. **CORS Configuration Issues**
- **Issue**: CORS allows all routes with `allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000']` and `allowCredentials: true`
- **Risk**: Potential CORS misconfiguration allowing unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **Recommendation**: Restrict origins to trusted domains, especially since system is internet-accessible
- **Priority**: High - prevents unauthorized cross-origin access

### 6. **Weak Password Requirements**
- **Issue**: Password validation uses `zxcvbn(value).score >= 2`
- **Risk**: Weak passwords may be accepted, vulnerable to brute force
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper password policy with minimum requirements
- **Priority**: Medium - balance security with usability

### 7. **Docker Security Issues**
- **Issue**:
  - Uses root user in containers
  - No resource limits defined
  - API insecure mode enabled in Traefik
  - Weak MinIO credentials in example
- **Risk**: Container breakout, resource exhaustion, unauthorized API access
- **Recommendation**: Use non-root users, set resource limits, disable insecure API
- **Priority**: Medium - operational stability and attack surface reduction

### 8. **File Upload Security**
- **Issue**: File processing lacks comprehensive validation beyond MIME checking
- **Risk**: Malicious file uploads via web interface
- **Recommendation**: Implement file type validation and size limits
- **Priority**: Medium - data integrity and system protection

### 9. **Webhook Security**
- **Issue**: Webhooks support optional access tokens but no rate limiting
- **Risk**: Abuse of webhook endpoints by external actors
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting and webhook signature verification
- **Priority**: Medium - prevents abuse of integration features

### 10. **Session Security**
- **Issue**: Basic session configuration without security hardening
- **Risk**: Session fixation, insufficient security headers
- **Recommendation**: Implement secure session settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- **Priority**: Medium - protects user sessions from external threats

## ðŸŸ¢ Positive Security Measures (Keep)

- JWT token implementation with proper expiration
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Input validation using custom validators
- HTTPS enforcement in production configs
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Client-side link security

## ðŸ“‹ Prioritized Action Items (Internet-Accessible Context)

### Immediate (This Week) - Critical Vulnerabilities
1. **Update vulnerable dependencies** - Run `npm audit fix` and update validator package
2. **Secure environment variables** - Replace all demo/weak credentials with strong, unique values
3. **Enable CSRF protection** - Uncomment and configure CSRF settings in `server/config/security.js`

### Short Term (1-2 Weeks) - Core Security
4. **Fix CORS configuration** - Restrict origins to trusted domains only
5. **Implement input sanitization** - Use `escape-html` and `escape-markdown` consistently
6. **Strengthen password policy** - Implement proper minimum requirements

### Medium Term (1 Month) - Enhanced Protection
7. **Secure Docker deployment** - Add non-root users, resource limits, disable insecure API
8. **Add file upload validation** - Implement comprehensive file type and size checking
9. **Implement rate limiting** - Add rate limiting for API endpoints and webhooks

### Long Term (Ongoing) - Monitoring & Maintenance
10. **Regular security updates** - Keep dependencies updated and monitor for new vulnerabilities
11. **Security monitoring** - Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious activities

## Risk Assessment Summary

For an internet-accessible system with limited discoverability:
- **Overall Risk Level**: High (due to external exposure)
- **Primary Concerns**: External attack vectors, credential compromise, dependency vulnerabilities
- **Critical Gaps**: CSRF protection, CORS configuration, dependency updates
- **Monitoring Needed**: External access logs, failed authentication attempts, unusual traffic patterns

## Audit Information
- **Audit Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Auditor**: Kilo Code (AI Security Engineer)
- **Project Version**: Planka 2.0.0-rc.4
- **Context**: Internet-accessible team tool, ~200 users, limited discoverability
- **Scope**: Full security audit with emphasis on external attack vectors

The system requires immediate attention to critical security issues before production deployment, despite limited public awareness. External accessibility significantly increases risk profile compared to fully internal systems.
